# TODO

1. Minimum viable app to load list of URLS ✅
2. Minimum viable caching ✅
3. Custom view to act as a full replacement of `LPLinkView`
   1. Extract favicon and preview image ✅
   2. Display view that is either more full with preview image or something that resembles the 'no metadata view' but with the favicon ✅
   3. Extract the dominant colors from image (or favicon) to help with coloring of the view like `LPLinkView` ✅
